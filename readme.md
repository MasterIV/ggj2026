# Maskztec Survivors

Battle relentless hordes in a fast-paced, Aztec-inspired survival action game where ancient gods still hunger. Wield three powerful elemental masks, each channeling a different force of nature, and switch between them on the fly to exploit enemy weaknesses. As the chaos escalates, mastery isn’t just about raw power, but knowing which mask to wear when the darkness closes in.
